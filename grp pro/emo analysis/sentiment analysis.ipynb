Because of the online semester, there were time limits and hard questions. The assignment is easy if you read the ppt slides. Find normal groupmates and come up with a good idea. Professor is cool and friendly, always answers your questions. But idk why I got B+, I was expecting A- at least tbh. I guess that happened because of the online semester. The overall impression was good, recommend taking that course.\n",

The coursework has changed a bit due to the Wuhan Coronavirus, not sure if these changes will keep in next year or not. But make sure that you attend every lecture and tutorial, participate in class and do your work, then everything will be fine. Just like the previous comments, the exam is pretty easy to handle as most of the information could be copied from your lecture notes, yet you are still expected to offer personal opinions on some controversial issues discussed in this course's lectures and tutorials.Conclusion: hard work will certainly pay off.\n",

There were quizzes after every lesson, so you better go to the class or get a friend to complete them for you. There was one big presentation, and a video was required, for 6 people per group, the workload per student is not that heavy (if there is no freerider) .The exam was easy, basically just the questions in the notes and assignments.And most importantly, should you choose this course if you are not a science student ? i would say yes , since it is one of the easier courses in area 3. The questions distributions are around 50% calculation and 50% theoretical. the theoretical part is ez to deal with since they are directly from notes. For the math part, if you studied basic science before, it should be simple for you. It leans more towards the Physics side rather than geography. Being a physics major student, I grab the A grade with zero effort and zero hour being put into revision, so easy that its like grabbing your girlfriend. So yeah, i rate 9.5/10 for a area 3 course, especially for those who likes big classes or natural disasters (the same thing actually).\n",

It is a trick for someone who is not familiar with poster design.3) The academic essay is the most important part. You have to develop the selected topic with taught of references.

The homework is a multiple-choice question (around 5-6 items per week). Then select one answered the question to explain within 200-300 words.2) The group project is fantastic. The topic is free to choose from. The only issue that students would remind is trying hard to apply the information from the lecture to explain your selected problem.P.s.
