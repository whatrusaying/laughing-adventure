"think course best suits people active class attentive. without participation, would say, easy lost track. course contains 3 quizes, quite easy, really pay attention class, cos questions covered lecture. really pay attention class (i know hard, really helpful), need much time revision (it took around 15 min revision test). final group project make booklet poster. really much coordinate work within team, cos parts easy devided evenly. course stressed lot logic, answer questions systemic organised way. hard though, remember show process question answer step step."
"fair workload. overall, one big project devided different phrases, easier keep track process project, groupmate selection important, students studied research (e.g. psychology/ marketing majorwould definitely advantage). however, group size rather large (around 8), takes time admin work. easy exam, around 40 mcs. exam covers course pack notes, remember buy course pack although really expensive :p (around $300)"
"tutor take pop-quiz attendance class.2 take home assignment (v.easy study geography high school), 1 open book class quiz (no talking, use computer search answer google), 1 cloud observation project (whole day observation consecutive day observation), 1 poster presentation. but, peer evaluation 2 present seriously affect final grade(~20%), hard get good grade classmates unfriendly."
